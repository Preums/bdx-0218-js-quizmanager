Session Février 2018 - Promo JS - **Projet Quiz Manager**

### Objectives
-------------

This is a fork of the study project i have to do in agile team during my wild code school formation.
The main goal of the project is to provide a functionnal desktop website alloying to create and play to quiz.

The user's created quiz must be validated by an admin before been published to the available quiz list.
The creator can play to it before it is validated to test it.

The administrator have a password protected space to check, verify or delete the user's created quiz.
He can also change some elements of the website directly for his admin page.

### Installation
---------------

Clone the project and run `npm install`

Import the database from backup.sql

Change the value for user/password in the db.js file

### Attributions
---------------

I was particulary in charge of the sql database and most of the requests to it.
I was writting the play and create parts too.

This project allow me to better understand the NodJs express and Ejs tools.

It is too a great team experience.
